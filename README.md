# Auth0 Test App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running Locally

If you're running this locally make sure to update the start script in the package.json to include the port number to match the callback urls listed in the auth0 application!

Example:
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "PORT=9070 react-scripts start",
    ...
  },
```
